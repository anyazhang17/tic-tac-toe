# tic-tac-toe
Generates a board with nine cells using the traditional 3 x 3 layout and asks each of two users to choose one cell at a time. 
The users take turns, and each user marks the board cells with a naught O or a cross X. The game continues until either one 
of the users won or all cells on the board are marked with O or X. The user won when the three marks (O or X) are located on one line 
horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. 
A user can also play against one of two AI's: a simple AI that chooses moves randomly or a MiniMax that also never looses a game because it precalculates all possible moves.
